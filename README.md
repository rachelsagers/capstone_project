## Raw Data
The raw data is sorted into three directories for each pollutant, PM2.5, CO, and NO2. The data files are named with a city code, pollutant, and year. All data has been downloaded from the EPA air monitoring database.

## Code
The code is contained in separate files for each output or purpose. There are three files for organizing the raw data for each pollutant into a usable vector. Each output or figure had a code file associated with it.

## Figures
The output figures created by the code are contained in the figures directory.
